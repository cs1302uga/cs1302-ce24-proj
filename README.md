## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. As you know from precalculus, the derivative of a function of a real variable measures 
   the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change 
   in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of mathematics. For example, 
   the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's 
   velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.

   The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, 
   is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent 
   line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, 
   the derivative is often described as the "instantaneous rate of change", the ratio of the 
   instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.
